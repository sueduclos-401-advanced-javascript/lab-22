# LAB 22 - Class 22

## Project Name - Counter React App - Testing and Development

Code 401 Class 22 ReactTesting and Development

Write unit tests for a counter application, and then deploy the counter application to a variety of places.Your main implementation task for this lab will be to add unit tests for the main components within the starter code.

### Code Implementation

`Counter.test.js`: Write robust tests for the Counter component that must test:

* On clicking the - button, the state count variable should be decreased by 1
* On clicking the + button, the state count variable should be increased by 1
* When the state count variable changes, the HTML should update and match that change

`App.test.js`:
 
* Implement a snapshot test that asserts that the page looks as expected.

### Design Implementation

`styles.scss`

* Attempt to style this counter application differently from your Lab 21 counter application
* Utilize at least one variable (for example $backgroundColor)
* Utilize SASS nesting capabilities
* Utilize partials so that your style code can be broken up across multiple files. `@use` these partials in your main `styles.scss/styles.sass` file

### Deployment

Deploy this counter application to three different services.

1. Netlify
2. AWS S3
3. AWS Amplify
